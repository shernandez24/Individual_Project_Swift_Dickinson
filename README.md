# Lyrical Analysis and Comparison of Taylor Swift's _folklore_ and _evermore_ to poet Emily Dickinson

i.	Introduction
For my Digital Humanities 101 individual project, I will compare singer-songwriter Taylor Swift’s eighth and ninth studio albums, folklore and evermore respectively, to Emily Dickinson’s poetry. Swift’s albums folklore and evermore, both released in 2020, received critical acclaim and praise for their poetic lyricism and themes of nostalgia and escapism. Written and produced during quarantine, Swift strayed from her usual autobiographical writing style found in her previous work and created a world of fictional narratives like the likes and legacies of folk songs and poets, like Dickinson. Dickinson has been regarded as one of the most notable and important figures in American poetry. She lived most of her life in isolation, surrounded by and kept company by the works and writings of other authors and metaphysical poets. Dickinson’s poetry, crafted in solitude, mirrors the conditions in which folklore and evermore were created as well. 

ii.	Research Question
Given the scope of this project and my own abilities and limitations, I have centered my research question to be: What are the lyrical similarities and differences between Swift and Dickinson’s poetry? Through answering this question, I hope to also uncover: Are there any overlapping words or phrases employed by both poets across their work? I also wonder if their composition under situations of isolation have influenced their work in similar or differing ways. Swift’s poetry has been compared to poets of the past before, most notably to the “Lake poets,” a group of English poets from England (William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and Robert Southey), to which she references in folklore (deluxe version)’s 17th track, the lakes (“Take me to the Lakes / where all the poets / went to die”). Her lyricism has also been compared to metaphysical poet John Donne. I’ve chosen to delve into potential lyrical parallels between Swift and female poet Dickinson since most comparisons to the singer-songwriter are with male writers. Throughout my research, I discovered that Dickinson is Swift’s sixth cousin five times removed, which adds another layer of interest to my own comparison of their work. 

iii.	Materials/Methods
As a fan of both writers, I have chosen to focus my individual project on a lyrical analysis of both poets. For this project, I will use all 17 tracks’ lyrics from folklore (deluxe version) and evermore (deluxe version) courtesy of Genius and “Poems by Emily Dickinson, Three Series, Complete” courtesy of Project Gutenberg. I will convert the song lyrics into .txt files and import the plain text version of Dickinson’s poetry collection into a Jupyter Notebook and analyze word frequencies from all three sources to create word clouds and bar plots related to word frequency. To ensure my analysis of the texts is true to the source, I will be removing punctuation and stop words in “Poems by Emily Dickinson, Three Series, Complete” to avoid including filler and/or common words in my word cloud and bar plots.

iv.	Results
Throughout this research process, I expect to find overlapping similarities in lyrics between Swift’s albums and Dickinson’s poetry. In Swift’s album evermore, the song ivy tells the story of a married/taken woman having an affair, featuring whimsical and escapist lyrics such as “my pain fits in the / palm of your freezing / hand / taking mine, but it’s / been promised to / another” and “clover blooms in the / fields / Spring breaks loose, / the time is near / What would he do if / he found us out?” The narrative told by Swift parallels the (alleged) relationship between Emily Dickinson and her childhood friend Sue Gilbert, who later became her sister-in-law after marrying Dickinson’s brother, Austin Dickinson. The two lived next door to each other and wrote “electric” love letters to one another. Swift even approved for her song to appear in the ninth episode of Apple TV’s comedy-drama series’ season three of “Dickinson” after a love scene between the characters based on Emily and Sue. The apparent real-world connections between Swift and Dickinson therefore have led me down the rabbit hole of discovering more parallels between the two writers.

v.	Discussion
I hope to gain a new understanding of both Swift and Dickinson’s work throughout working on this project. By analyzing the language in their respective albums and poetry, I will be immersed in their work that was born out of isolation, hopefully discovering artistic parallels that mirror one another and society/quarantine at large. I hope that this project is another step forward in incorporating pop culture and data feminism into the field of digital humanities projects due to the focus on female writers and society at large.
